# Roulette_table
A program that simulates a simplified roulette table.
The program gives the user a starting balance of 500$ and lets the user play until they run out of money. The user can bet on a color (Red or Green) or the user can bet on a number (0-36). The table is a simplified version of the normal roulette table in order to make understanding the table easier for the user. Even numbers are red, odd numbers are black, and zero is green.
